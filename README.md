# Gerk.ThreadedWorkQueue
Originally part of logic used to log on a seperate thread. This has been abstracted out to be useful for any situation where you want to ensure work gets done, don't want it to intefere with the standard running of the process and don't care that it gets handled immediatly.

Currently it is only single threaded.

Documentation should be included within XML docs.
